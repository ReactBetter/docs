# Tooling Installation Guide

Thankfully, most of the tools in our trade are available for free. Here are external guides on how to download and install them.

## IDE (Download One)

Your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the app you'll use to write your code. There are several great options. For React, we prefer VS Code.

- [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    - VS Code is free and available on all major platforms, including Linux. It has an extensive library of easy-to-use extensions, a built-in terminal, and live sharing capabilities.
- [Download Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/download)

## Required CLI Tools (Download All)

In addition to an IDE, you'll need an environment where your code can run. These tools will get you there.

- [Download Homebrew (Mac Only)](https://brew.sh/)
- - Mac users will find installing apps significantly easier with Homebrew. We highly recommend getting it.
- [Download Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- We prefer to use NVM to install both Node and NPM; this will allow you to easily switch which version of Node you are using at any time.
- - [NVM on Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/nvm-install-multiple-nodejs-versions-in-linux/)
- - [NVM on Mac](https://tecadmin.net/install-nvm-macos-with-homebrew/)
- - [NVM on Windows](https://dev.to/skaytech/how-to-install-node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows-10-4nbi)

## Terminals (Download One)

Your shell comes with a terminal, but there are many options out there. You can download a new one or even pimp out your existing one.

Our preferences actually depend on our operating system for this.

### Mac
Mac users have an amazing option known as iTerm2! It's incredible. Download it, add ZSH, and enjoy. Your default terminal works, but iTerm2 is (in our opinion) the top of the terminal food chain.

- [Download iTerm2 With ZSH & Oh-My-ZSH](https://medium.com/ayuth/iterm2-zsh-oh-my-zsh-the-most-power-full-of-terminal-on-macos-bdb2823fb04c)
- - What's this? An all-in-one guide for iTerm2 with ZSH! This guide will help you get iTerm2, add ZSH, and customize it with oh-my-zsh.

### Linux
The default terminal in Linux is wonderful. We still like adding some ZSH flavor.

- [Add ZSH & Oh-My-ZSH For Linux](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-setup-zsh-and-oh-my-zsh-on-linux/)

### Windows
The Windows default terminal options (whether you're used to using Command Prompt and PowerShell) are generally terrible. We prefer installing the Bash shell, then adding ZSH to it. But it's not as straightforward as simply downloading & installing; there are some extra steps along the way. The reason is simple - "Because Windows."

After enabling Bash, use the next link to add ZSH. Continue following the directions down that page to make sure ZSH always automatically launches by default.

- [Add ZSH To Bash For Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/258518/how-to-use-zsh-or-another-shell-in-windows-10/)
- [Customize ZSH With Oh-My-ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki)

## Optional CLI Tools (Download As Needed)

These tools exist to make life easier. Some might be recommended or even required by specific projects, but might not be required for everyone.
